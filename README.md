The objective is to mimick directory structures via a tree. When viewing the task, a false assumption that can be quickly
made based on the tree picture is to craft a solution with Binary Trees using only 2 nodes. After some thought, it becomes
clear that this is not a binary tree problem but rather a Tree with N nodes such that each node can have 0 or more leafs.
