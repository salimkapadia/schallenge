The objective is to mimick directory structures via a tree.

To run, type in php run.php . In order to see results, I will need more time to add pre-order traversal.

Also, I made the assumption this is a binary tree from the first 2 tasks, but its clear that this is a standard tree with
N nodes.

I'll need some time to fix up the code.
