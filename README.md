h2 Objective
The objective is to mimick directory structures via a tree. When viewing the task, a false assumption that can be quickly
made based on the tree picture is to craft a solution with Binary Trees using only 2 nodes. After some thought, it becomes
clear that this is not a binary tree problem but rather a Tree with N nodes such that each node can have 0 or more leafs.

To run the application, navigate to the tests folder and run the following command
{code}
php run.php
{code}

h2. TODO
- Part 1,2,3 are done. Part 4 and 5 use the same Node structure with a minor change. 
- need to implement preorder traveral for output of code but

Salim.
